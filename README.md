### Service concurrency limiting with RSocket requests lease

This example demonstrates how to perform latency/stats based call concurrency limiting & circuit breaking
of Message-Streams/RSocket-RPC services with [RSocket requests leasing](https://jauntsdn.com/post/rsocket-lease-concurrency-limiting/).

Application consists of single RSocket-RPC client connecting set of RSocket-RPC servers via reverse proxy.

1. [Servers](https://github.com/jauntsdn/rsocket-requests-lease-examples/blob/feature/oss/jaunt-rsocket-requests-lease/src/main/java/com/jauntsdn/rsocket/showcase/lease/server/Main.java) 
provide RPC [service](https://github.com/jauntsdn/rsocket-requests-lease-examples/blob/feature/oss/jaunt-rsocket-requests-lease/src/main/java/com/jauntsdn/rsocket/showcase/lease/server/SaturableService.java) 
with saturation - its response latencies grow with number of concurrent requests. Also server has lease controller
which collects service response stats & allows constant # of requests on responder side, at fixed rate (rate limiting).

2. [Proxy](https://github.com/jauntsdn/rsocket-requests-lease-examples/blob/feature/oss/jaunt-rsocket-requests-lease/src/main/java/com/jauntsdn/rsocket/showcase/lease/proxy/Main.java) 
routes requests from client to least loaded server using `RSocket.availability()` - which represents # of 
non-expired allowed requests on requester side: [0 ; 1].
It rejects requests if there are no servers ready to accept request (servers are absent, or all servers have 0 availability)

3. [Client](https://github.com/jauntsdn/rsocket-requests-lease-examples/blob/feature/oss/jaunt-rsocket-requests-lease/src/main/java/com/jauntsdn/rsocket/showcase/lease/client/Main.java) 
sends RPC requests to `Proxy` then reports # of successful and failed responses, together with 
observed response latencies.

[RSocket-JVM runtimes](https://jauntsdn.com/post/rsocket-jvm/) are stripped on this branch.
